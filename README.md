# QM_MoP

This repository contains code to calculate the Method of Planes (MoP) stress in the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) using the MACE machine learning potential. The Method of Planes (MoP) is a pressure measurement used in molecular dynamics (MD) from B. D. Todd, Denis J. Evans, and Peter J. Daivis: “Pressure tensor for inhomogeneous fluids”, Phys. Rev. E 52, 1627 (1995) ([see e.g. LAMMPS documentation][https://docs.lammps.org/compute_stress_mop.html]). This simply ends up being force divided by area but has the useful property that it is the only pressure which can be linked to the control volume balance equations, making it valid arbitarily far from equilibirum. The attached code and associated manuscript show this is valid for MACE, and more generally machine learning potentials which use graph networks, extending the work of Langer et al (2023) to local forms of pressure.

The validaity of this approach is demonstrated by showing the MoP pressure respects static equilibirum near a liquid-solid interface (a test which the virial or IK1 form fails) as well as conservation in an arbitary control volume between two planes (a test for validity that can be used in any system).
